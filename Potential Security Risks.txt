Potential Security Risks:
1. Outdated Software  
   - Debian 7 is from ~2013 and may lack critical security patches.
   - OpenSSH 10.0p2 is vulnerable to known exploits.

2. Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)  
   - CVE-2024-6387: Race condition in sshd signal handling.  
   - CVE-2025-26465: Host key verification flaw enabling MITM attacks.

3. Brute-force Attack Surface  
   - SSH is frequently targeted by bots and attackers using password guessing.

4. Weak Configuration Risks  
   - If root login is enabled or password authentication is allowed, system is more vulnerable.

5. Internet Exposure  
   - If the host is publicly accessible, attackers can scan and target it easily.

6. Lack of Monitoring 
   - Without proper logging, unauthorized access attempts may go unnoticed.
